FLOWERS AND TEMPLES 

I have x flowers initially and n temples
I will visit n temples and every time i visit , my flowers get multiplied by 2 and subtracted from a number y (which is constant for all visits)
at the end of visiting n temples , my x becomes zero 

find values of x (initial ) and y

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
	    Scanner obj = new Scanner(System.in);
	    int n = obj.nextInt();
	    
	    int  y = 1;
	    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	    {
	        y = y*2;
	    }
	    int x = y - 1;
	    System.out.println(x+" "+y);
	}
}
